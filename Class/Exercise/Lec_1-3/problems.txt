Exercise:

1. Find the root of the f (x) = x*e^x − 1 = 0 using all the three methods, corrected up to three decimal places.

2. Find the root of the cos(x) − x*e^x= 0 using all the three methods, corrected up to three decimal places.

3. Determine the smallest positive root of x − e^(−x) up to three significant figure.

4. Find a root of x*sin(x) + cos(x) = 0

5. Find the square root of 18 using Newton-Raphson method.
    (Hints: you need to solve x^2 − n = 0 where n is the number and x is its square root.)
