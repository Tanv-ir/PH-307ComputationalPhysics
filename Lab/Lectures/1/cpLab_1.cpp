//This is a raw cpp/c++ file that can be compiled with GCC or other c/c++ compiler

//Problem
/*
write a c++ code to determine the value of e^x using e = (x^0)/0! + (x^1)/1! + (x^2)/2! + ... + (x^n)/n!

Also plot a graph of
    i)e^x vs x where n is a fixed value
   ii)e^x vs n where x is a fixed value
*/

//Solution

//In this Solution I decided not to use the cmath library
